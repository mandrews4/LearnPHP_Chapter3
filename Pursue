Q Load feedback.html in your Web browser without going through a URL
  (i.e., the address bar would likely start with file:// ). Fill out
  and submit the form. Observe the result so that you can recognize
  this problem, and understand its cause, in case you see similar
  results in the future.
A All php language constructs are not interpreted

Q If you have not already, and if you can, make sure that display_errors
  is enabled on your development environment.
A I'm using XAMPP w/ php 5.4.7 and display_errors is enabled

Q If you have not already, and if you can, make sure that error_reporting
  is set to E_ALL | E_STRICT on your development environment.
A Error_reporting is set to "E_ALL | E_STRICT" by default

Q Try introducing different errors in a PHP script—by improperly balancing
  quotation marks, failing to use semicolons, referring to variables
  improperly, and so on—to see the result.
A Very useful to locate typos, unmatched quotes and similar errors

Q Experiment with the hello.html and the hello.php pages to send different
  values, including numbers, to the PHP script through the URL.
A My first interpretation is that php seems to be treating all values
  (i.e. letters, numbers) as strings when retrieving their values from
  the _GET array and printing their value.

  See hello_numbers.html for example HTML code.

Q Create a variation on hello.html that sends multiple name=value pairs to a
  PHP script. Have the PHP script then print all the received values.
A See hello_multiple_NameVals.html & hello_multiple_NameVals.php

Q If you’re the inquisitive type, and don’t mind waiting for answers, try
  passing more complicated values to a page through the URL. Try using spaces
  and punctuation to see what happens.
A I'm using chrome on windows as the web browser. Embedding spaces in the URL
  arguments are usually auto-transformed into %20 character sequences, which
  represents the ascii numeric value for the space character.

  Substituting different separator characters for the space character vary in
  their behavior.

  If I use + as a separator, for example:

    http://localhost/URL?fname=John+Smith&lname=Jane+Doe

  the + character is displayed by the php code as a space character.

  However, if I use a comma as a separator:

    http://localhost/URL?fname=John,Smith&lname=Jane,Doe

  the comma is displayed by the php code as a comma.

Q Create a new HTML form that performs a task you envision yourself needing
  (or a lighter-weight version of that functionality). Then create the PHP
  script that handles the form, printing just the received data.
A See AddressBook.html & AddressBook.php for a simple form and php code which
  prompts for information for an address book entry, and displays the entered
  key/value pairs.
